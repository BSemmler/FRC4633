Add a list of things to do here and state their importance between "1 - 10"

Also add which language this needs to be programmed in. If unsure place "??" 
after ranking value. 

Add code quality rating with a number between "1 - 5" 
e.g. if a piece of code is guaranteed to work each time with no bugs or errors
then give it a value of "5". If it is code thats rough but usable give it a
rating of "1". If the code is incomplete give "0"

If a piece of Code is complete Give it the tag "COMPLETE" else give INCOMPLETE
 
If it is not a programming specific task Add "General"
after the Ranking. 

Example:
NAME - Importance Ranking - Language - Quality - COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE
  - Details if any / subtasks
